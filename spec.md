---

## Error Handling

- Fallback to uploadthing if Supabase Storage fails
- Statuses and actions validated server-side
- All critical actions (status changes, purchases) require confirmation modals
- No audit logging for MVP

---

## Out of Scope for MVP
- Real payments/tokenization/smart contracts
- KYC/AML

---

## Notes
